KSS Pairing Friendly Curves

A simple Sagemath program to find KSS Pairing-friendly curves with nice twists and small $\rho$

See comments at start of the program to perform a search. You need to provide

K - the embedding degree

D - the Complex Multiplication discriminant, 1 or 3

nz - the number of non-zero elements in the power basis, typically 2 or 3

lim - the maximum absolute size of the coefficient of each element of the basis, typcially 2
